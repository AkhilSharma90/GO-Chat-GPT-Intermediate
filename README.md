# GO-Chat-GPT-Intermediate
A code sample to work with chat-GPT using GO, intermediate level of difficulty
1. Give it a code snippet and this code will prompt chat-GPT to list out all the libraries being used in that code snippet
2. I tested this for Rust, GO, Python. You can change the code, right now it says "python", change it to any language you like and also change the code snippet in the input-file and see the magic.
